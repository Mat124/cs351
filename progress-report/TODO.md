2.2 change wording about documentation

2.3 analyse which parts are open-source and which arenâ€™t

3.1 rename section

3.2 demonstrate what has been done - include serial output, image of linux booting, code snippets, etc

3.3.2 rewording, show screenshot of serial output

4 create gantt chart showing detailed tasks for each week or two until deadline - project management and adequate documentation are some of the most important parts!

Run benchmarks on individual cores even if nota the same time

include reference for MoSCoW

mention RISC-V open source vs proprietary sides, maybe as a table - Nvidia paid them???
