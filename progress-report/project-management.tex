TODO: chart of what has been achieved and a gantt chart of what will be achieved in the future, split into roughly 1/2 week chunks
%Include a timetable (in 2 week chunks) for the remainder of the academic year, up until the submission deadline. What has been achieved, and was it expected?
The progress made so far has been mixed - some objectives have been achieved much faster than was expected, while other objectives have taken a significantly longer amount of time than expected. This has been tracked effectively using the Trello\cite{} board, and allowed for the project supervisor to be updated frequently as to how the project has been progressing.
