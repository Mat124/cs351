\begin{abstract}
    This project aims to design and analyse heterogeneous RISC-V SoCs implemented in FPGAs. Many devices have varying performance needs during use, and always aim to minimise power usage. Heterogeneous architectures aim to provide a solution that delivers high performance and high efficiency by combining highly efficient CPU cores (S cores) and highly powerful CPU cores (B cores) in a single processor. When performing background, low priority tasks the S cores are used and the B cores are idle/off, resulting in low power usage. When there are demanding, high priority tasks the B and S cores are used, resulting in higher performance than if just the S cores existed.

    The CPU cores implement the RISC-V ISA, an open-standard ISA with support for Linux. There is minimal research into general purpose RISC-V processors implementing a heterogeneous architecture, so the project will perform some novel research. The S and B cores will be designed using the RocketChip library, that generates HDL for a configurable RISC-V SoC.

    The designed heterogeneous SoC has been be benchmarked and compared to homogenous designs in terms of size, power draw and performance. Based on these metrics, heterogeneous RISC-V SoCs implemented in FPGAs have limited benefits over homogenous, with a B and S processors providing small decreases in power and area usage for significantly less performance compared to a two B processor, but giving much increased performance for very small power and area increases compared to a two S processor.
