\section{Methodology}
The design and implementation of this project is expected to be experimentation based, as there are a huge number of factors to consider in the hardware design process and the final design will be based on how these factors affect performance. The hardware implementation and software tests design and implementation will be dependant on this design stage, and an agile methodology will be used to allow for changes in the objectives as the design experimentation progresses.
