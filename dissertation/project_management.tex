\section{Methodology}
The design and implementation of this project is expected to be experimentation based, as there are a huge number of factors to consider in the hardware design process and the final design will be based on how these factors affect performance. The hardware implementation and software tests design and implementation will be dependant on this design stage, and an agile methodology will be used to allow for changes in the objectives as the design experimentation progresses.

\section{Progress Tracking and Time Management}
Tracking progress has been completed using a Kanban Trello board\footnote{https://trello.com/tour}, shared with the project supervisor. This board contains all tasks on the project, sorted into various categories depending on their current state: not started, doing, blocked, completed. The board also contains extra information, such as a category for questions/issues and submission dates.

Each task on the board is colour coded and has a label that describes the type of task (\ref{fig:trello}). Each task is also assigned a due date - this has been used to make decisions about what tasks to work on next, and makes it clear when we are failing to meet the current schedule. An example task is shown in \ref{fig:trello}, which includes a 'todo' list of what needs to be completed for the task to be checked off.

A project diary has also been kept (\ref{fig:diary}), detailing all work completed on the project and the dates of work. Each time work has been done on the project, we have written what was achieved, anything new that was learnt and the current thoughts on what needs to be done next time. This has meant that though there were occasions when there was over 5 days between work being done on the project, we could read the last few session notes to be reminded of the current project state and next steps.
